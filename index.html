    <h1>Hello, I'm Kirill!</h1>
   <p>I'm a Unity developer specializing in simulations for educational purposes.</p>
   <p>My simulations are designed to help students in schools learn subjects like physics, biology, and other disciplines according to the school curriculum.</p>

            <h3>The Circulatory System</h3>
            <p>This lesson focuses on the circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems (lungs, heart, blood plasma, red blood cells)
            in the context of material transport and cellular respiration. Students will understand the importance of supplying oxygen and glucose to cells,
            learn how glucose and oxygen reach cells from the external environment, understand the importance of removing carbon dioxide from cells and how it occurs. Additionally,
            students will understand the importance of the lungs and heart's activity and their contribution to cellular respiration.
            At the end, students will be able to predict the impact of increased heart and lung rates on system performance in cellular respiration.</p>

            <h3>Simulation 2 "The Electric Circuit" </h3>
            <p>In this lesson, we will create a virtual lab to examine the properties of the electric circuit. To do this,
             we will learn and define the roles of components in electrical circuits and understand the rules that allow for safe operation with electrical circuits.</p>
